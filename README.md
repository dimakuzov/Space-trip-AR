# Space-trip-AR

![Alt text](https://github.com/dimakuzov/Space-trip-AR/blob/master/SpaceTripAR.gif)

This is the continuation of my experimental game [WhiteHoleAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgi7ajah898) that was made with Vuforia. Now I did it on ARCore and with another visual content, and I decided to change the game's name. You may play it outdoors or at home if you have a few meters of free space in front of you.  

### [Sace Trip AR on GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Kuz.SpaceTripAR)

You can play in it on your android device. When you launch the app, it will prompt the Play Store to install ARCore if you donâ€™t already have it. You can check if your device is supported on this [list](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices).
